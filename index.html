				<h3>Fiverr</h3>
				<img src="fiverr.jpg">
				<p>Fiverr is another marketplace for freelancers. Overall platform is very well designed, though 20% fee is very concerning . That’s why this option is in the third place.</p>
				<p>Fiverr has recently introduced client invitation program, to work with new clients and pay 0% fee to Fiverr. Unfortunately this feature is limited and I don’t have access to it. Once it will be available, I will probably move this option higher</p>
