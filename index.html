		<h3>Upwork</h3>
		<p>Upwork is my default choice, since it offers good &amp; safe services and has reasonable service fees.

				<h3><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/diankristian">Fiverr</a></h3>
				<img class="img-fluid" src="fiverr.jpg" loading="lazy">
				<p>Fiverr is another marketplace that I am actively used. Overall platform is very well designed, though 20% fee is very concerning . That’s why this option is in the third place.</p>
				<p>Fiverr has recently introduced client invitation program, to work with new clients and pay 0% fee to Fiverr. Unfortunately this feature is limited and I don’t have access to it. Once it will be available, I will probably move this option higher</p>
